# Weather Module

This module is aimed to be the replacement for the current `currentweather` and `weatherforcast` modules. The module will be configurable to be used as a current weather view, or to show the forecast. This way the module can be used twice to fullfil both purposes. 

The biggest cange is the use of weather providers. This way we are not bound to one API source. And users can choose which API they want to use as their source. Initially the current OpenWeatherMap will be added as the first source, but more will follow soon. 

The module is in a very early stage, and needs a lot of work. It's API isn't set in stone, so keep that in mind when you want to contribute.
