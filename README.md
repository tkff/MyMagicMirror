This version of the Magic Mirror software focusses on a modular plugin system. Besides that, the Magic Mirror software now also uses [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), so no more webserver or browser installs necessary.

**WARNING!** This version is in a *very* early stage. It is **not** completed yet. **Please** use the master branch.

## Usage 
1. Download the latest node version:
  - `wget https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-v5.10.0-linux-armv6l.tar.gz` for Raspberry Pi
  - `wget https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-v5.10.0-linux-armv7l.tar.gz` for Raspberry Pi 2
2. Unpack the archive file: `tar -xvf filename`
3. Install `cd foldername && sudo cp -R * /usr/local/`
4. Set loglevel `npm config set loglevel info`
5. `npm install && npm start` (You may have to restart your terminal before this works)

**Important:** `npm start` does NOT work via SSH you have to execute it in a terminal session running in a window-manager.

## Configuration
1. Duplicate `config/config.js.sample` to `config/config.js`.
2. Modify your required settings.

## Todo List
Things that still have to be implemented or changed.

- [ ] Allow show/hide animations to animate the height. This way, the other modules won't jump around.
- [ ] Allow vertical centering of alerts.
- [ ] Rewrite the [alert](modules/default/alert) module in vanilla JavaScript.
- [ ] Write all the documentation.
